# Airline-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

The dataset we chose to work with is “Airline Twitter Sentiment”. This dataset has twenty columns and over 14,000 rows. It contains information on brand reputation and customer experience for six major airlines in the United States. This project only extracted the tweet text data to perform sentiment analysis and text clustering.
